# Set Operations Assignment (Team 27)

Both the python and javascript versions can be run with the same argument, with two file paths and a set operation:

- python3 setops.py "set1=a.txt;set2=b.txt;operation={union|intersection|difference}"
- node setops.js "set1=a.txt;set2=b.txt;operation={union|intersection|difference}"
